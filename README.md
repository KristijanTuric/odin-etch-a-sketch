# odin-etch-a-sketch

## Following Odin Project

[Odin Project Etch-A-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch "Click Me!")
- [X] 1. Set up a Git Repo for this project.
- [X] 2. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. 
- [X] 3. Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- [ ] 4. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated *in the same total space as before* (e.g. 960px wide) so that youâ€™ve got a new sketch pad. **Tip**: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.
- [ ] 5. Push your project to GitHub!
- [ ] Extra credit...

Extra stuff I did:
 - User will now only draw when the left mouse button is being held down
 - Removed dragging as it interfiered with drawing when the mouse was held over an already colored square
