Demo: [Etch-A-Sketch](https://kristijanturic.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/)

- [X] 1. Set up a Git Repo for this project.
- [X] 2. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- [X] 3. Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- [X] 4. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated *in the same total space as before* (e.g. 960px wide) so that youâ€™ve got a new sketch pad. **Tip**: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.
- [X] 5. Push your project to GitHub!

Extra stuff I did:

- [X] User will now only draw when the left mouse button is being held down
- [X] Removed dragging as it interfiered with drawing when the mouse was held over an already colored square
- [X] Added a Clear button
- [X] Made the grid size selector, a range type selector
- [X] Added color picking functionality
- [X] Make a button that makes your colors random, rainbow color button
- [X] Eraser button
- [ ] Needs to be fixed to work on modern browsers
